# TrackZone


## What is TrackZone

Suppose you have 3 international client . They lives in different location (USA, Australia, England). You have meetings everyday with those clients , but the meeting time is not fixed. When the clients fix a time they will let you know the meeting time. But the problem is , they will tell you the meeting time in their local timezone. For example , the Australian client fixed a meeting at 5.00 PM in australian time. So what will be the time of that meeting in your local area. How will remember all the meeting times with different time zone?

This is an application which is able to store meeting time based on specific timezone. It has various time zone such as UTC , PST , EST . User can create clock for specific timezone and can add meetings on that clock.
Each meeting will show the time of that meeting in selected clock timezone and local timezone also. It also shows the time difference of that selected timezone and users local timezone.

## How to use?

- 1. Create your default clock.
- 2. Create other clock in other timezone for each client.
- 3. Add meetings under client clock
